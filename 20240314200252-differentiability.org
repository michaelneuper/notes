#+title: Differentiability

* Definition
- Let \(f\) be a function, \(a\in\mathbb{R}\) and \(I\) some open [[id:a995fc0e-d695-4662-a94f-4daad08de069][interval]].
- \(f\) is differentiable at \(a\) if \(f'(a)\) exists.
- \(f\) is differentiable on \(I\) if \(f\) is differentiable at \(c\) for every \(c\in I\).
- \(f\) is differentiable if \(f\) is differentiable at all \(c\in\text{dom}(f)\)

* Theorem
For any function \(f\) and any \(a\in\mathbb{R}\), if \(f\) is differentiable at \(a\), then \(f\) is [[id:9f66f38c-1072-4146-9efe-5a90f984d480][continuous]] at \(a\)

* Not Differentiable
- \(f\) has a discontinuity at \(a\)
- \(f\) has a vertex at \(a\)
- \(f\) has a vertical tangent at \(a\)

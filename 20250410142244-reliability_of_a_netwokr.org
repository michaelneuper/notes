#+title: Reliability of a Network

* Definition
\begin{equation*}
R_{0} = P(\Phi(X) = 1)
\end{equation*}
 where \(R_{0}\) is the probability that the network is in the up state.

 We can rewrite the network reliability as \(R_{0} = E[\Phi(X)]\) as the [[id:ec08bf1f-90a5-429a-94f5-fb027476fb8e][expected value]] of \(\Phi(X)\).

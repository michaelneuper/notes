#+title: Complement (lattices)

* Definition
If \(L\) is a bouned [[id:23181ae0-1b33-4f38-ad20-a2b9f47ef856][lattice]], where \(1_{L}\) is its max element and \(0_{L}\) is its min element then a complement of an element \(x\in L\) is another element \(x' \in L\) such that
\begin{equation*}
x \wedge x' = 0_{L} \text{ and } x \vee x' = 1_{L}
\end{equation*}

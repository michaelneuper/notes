#+title: Space Curve

* Definition
Suppose \(f\), \(g\) and \(h\) are [[id:9f66f38c-1072-4146-9efe-5a90f984d480][continuous]] real-valued [[id:87d42439-b03b-48be-84ab-2215b4733dd7][functions]] on an interval \(I\).
Then the set \(C\) of all points \((x,y,z)\) in space, where
\(x =f(t)\), \(y = g(t)\), \(z=h(t)\) and \(t\) varies throughout the intercal \(I\) is called a *space curve*.

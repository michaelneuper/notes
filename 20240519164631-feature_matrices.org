* Maximal Feature Matrix
|       | [i] | [u] |
|-------+-----+-----|
| front | +   | -   |
| back  | -   | +   |
| high  | -   | -   |
| low   | +   | +   |
| round | -   | +   |

Note rows 3-4 do not help distinguish the sounds, and row 2 is redundant.

* Minimal Feature Matrix
|       | [i] | [u] |
|-------+-----+-----|
| front | +   | -   |

* Note
A feature matrix with \(n\) columns will need to have \(n-1\) rows to uniquely distinguish the features.

* Equation 1
An equation of the parabola with vertex at \((h, k)\), focus \((h,p + k)\) and directrix \(y =k -p\) is
\begin{equation*}
(x - h)^2 = 4p(y-k)
\end{equation*}

* Equation 2
An equation of the parabola with vertex at \((h, k)\), focus \((p + h, k)\) and directrix \(x =h -p\) is
\begin{equation*}
(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)
\end{equation*}

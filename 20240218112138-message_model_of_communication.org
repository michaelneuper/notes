* A - Encoding
Makes *encoding* possible.
i.e. "package" imperceptible ideas into perceptible code.
* B - Decoding
Makes *decoding* possible.
i.e. "unpack" imperceptible ideas into perceptible code.

* Assumptions
Language is:
- a mental system
- which is used to convey information
- through encoding and decoding of meaning.

* "Container" Metaphor
- Linguistic expressions = /containers/
- We pack information into the containers (=encoding=)
- The sender depacks them (=decoding=)

#+title: Stretching

Let \(c\in\mathbb{R}\) with \(c>1\) and let \(f\) be any function. Then the graph of:

- \(y=cf(x)\) is given by *stretching* the graph of \(y=f(x)\) *vertically* by \(c\) units
- \(y=\frac{1}{c}f(x)\) is given by *shrinking* the graph of \(y=f(x)\) *vertically* by \(c\) units
- \(y=f(cx)\) is given by *shrinking* the graph of \(y=f(x)\) *horizontally* by \(c\) units
- \(y=f\left(\frac{1}{c}x\right)\) is given by *stretching* the graph of \(y=f(x)\) *horizontally* by \(c\) units

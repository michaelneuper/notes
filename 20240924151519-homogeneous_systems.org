#+title: Homogeneous Systems
#+filetags: linear_algebra linear_equations

* Definition
#+begin_quote
A system of [[id:de4c53ce-6aa5-4e56-a0e1-3918d18a17c4][linear equations]] is called *homogeneous* if the constant term in each equation is zero.

A homogeneous system has either
- a unique solution (the zero/trivial solution)
- infinitely many solutions
#+end_quote

* Theorem
If \([A \mid \mathbf{0}]\) is a homogeneous system of \(m\) linear equations with \(n\) variables, where \(m<n\), then the system has infinitely many solutions.

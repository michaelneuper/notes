#+title: Sample Spaces with Equally Likely Outcomes
#+filetags: axioms_of_probability

Consider a [[id:33838eb4-aa50-4794-baa1-637ddea744ad][sample space]] with \(N\) outcomes that are all *equally likely* to occur:

\(S = \{1, 2, \cdots N\}\), with \(P(\{1\}) = P(\{2\}) = \cdots P(\{N\})\)

Then \(P(S) = P(\{1\} \cup \{2\} \cup \cdots \{N\})\)

\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=1}^N P(\{i\}) = 1 \\
\therefore P(\{i\}) = \frac{1}{N}
\end{equation*}

If all the outcomes of a certain experiment are equally likely, then for any event \(E\) in the sample space \(S\),

\begin{equation*}
P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|}
\end{equation*}

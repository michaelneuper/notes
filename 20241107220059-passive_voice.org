#+title: Passive Voice

The passive voice is used when we want to emphasise the action ([[id:d1cfe60a-53d4-470a-aea5-4b4bc9890d8f][verb]]) and the object of a sentence rather than subject.

This means that the subject is either less important than the action itself or that we don't know who or what the subject is.

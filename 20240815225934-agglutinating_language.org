#+title: Agglutinating Languages

* Generalisation
Functional ([[id:f9efe42e-017f-4ede-9406-ab0526729e43][grammatical]]) information, unlike lexical (content) information, is encoded via [[id:afd36133-0af4-41f7-a158-cc74636e0e6c][affixes]] which combine with the latter in a regular manner.

* Notes
- Agglutinating (from Latin /agglutinare/, meaning 'to glue together')
- [[id:6520f76a-6137-4e67-bfb9-0e3fd7b8e628][Morphemes]] tend to 'glue' together but hold their shape
- Each morpheme tends to convery one piece of information

* Example: Quenchua
- wasi-n-ku
- house-3P-PL
- "their house"

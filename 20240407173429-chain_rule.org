#+title: Chain Rule

* General Version
Suppose that \(u\) is a differentiable function of the \(n\) variables \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n}\) and each \(x_j\) is a differentiable function of the \(m\) variables \(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m\). Then \(u\) is a function of \(t_1, t_2 \ldots , t_m\) and

\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t_i} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial t_i} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}\frac{\partial x_2}{\partial t_i} + \cdots + \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_n}\frac{\partial x_n}{\partial t_i}
\end{equation*}

for each \(i = 1, 2, \ldots, m\).

* Definition for Single-variable Functions
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dt} \cdot \frac{dt}{dx}
\end{equation*}


* Definition for Functions of Two Variables
** Case 1
Suppose that \(z = f(x(t), y(t))\) is a [[id:086cb8a0-bd8b-465a-8b0c-65d60f454421][differentiable function]] of \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\), where \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) are both differentiable functions of \(t\).
Then \(z\) is a differentiable function of \(t\) and

\begin{equation*}
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}
\end{equation*}
** Case 2
Suppose that \(z = f(x(s,t), y(s,t))\) is a differentiable function of \(x(s,t)\) and \(y(s,t)\), where \(x(s,t)\) and \(y(s,t)\) are differentiable functions of \(s\) and \(t\).
Then

\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial z}{\partial s} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial s} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial s}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
\end{equation*}

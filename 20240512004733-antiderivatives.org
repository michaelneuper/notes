#+title: Antiderivatives
#+filetags: calculus derivatives integration

* Definition
#+begin_quote
Let \(f, F\) be functions and \(I\) and interval.
Then \(F\) is an *antiderivative* of \(f\) on \(I\) if \(F'(x) = f(x)\) for all \(x\in I\).
#+end_quote

* Notes
\(F\) an antiderivative of \(f\) on \(I\) subsumes:
- Both \(F\) and \(f\) are defined on all of \(I\)
- \(F\) needs to be differentiable on \(I\)

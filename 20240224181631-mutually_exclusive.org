#+title: Mutually Exclusive Events

* Definition
Two [[id:33838eb4-aa50-4794-baa1-637ddea744ad][events]] are mutually exclusive if there is no [[id:196514bf-395b-4147-b6a6-917aeb283776][intersection]] between their [[id:56ae2cf4-a426-46fd-82eb-9acb3c8512ba][sets]] of possible outcomes.

i.e. they cannot occur at the same time.

* Conclusions
- \(E_1 \cap E_{2} = \varnothing\)
- \(P(E_1 \cap E_{2}) = 0\)

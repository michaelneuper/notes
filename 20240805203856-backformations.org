* Definition
#+begin_quote
The process of creating a new word via [[id:c976dfcf-a201-4be6-bf7d-df9e245a86c7][inflected]], typically by removing or substituting [[id:afd36133-0af4-41f7-a158-cc74636e0e6c][affixes]] in a way that expands the number of [[id:9fab0955-2bbe-4552-ad9f-d4591a89def9][lexemes]] associated with a [[id:8a1148be-ca0a-44cf-a140-c9e3191f8f90][root word]].

* Example
For example, the noun resurrection was borrowed from Latin, and the verb resurrect was then back-formed hundreds of years later from it by removing the -ion suffix.
This segmentation of resurrection into resurrect + ion was possible because English had examples of Latin words in the form of verb and verb+-ion pairs, such as opine/opinion.

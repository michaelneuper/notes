#+title: Lattice

* Definition
A [[id:e64ef180-2fff-4790-bf03-1920ea80b239][poset]] \(L\) is called a *lattice* if every pair of elements has a [[id:8112c919-97b7-4325-b9f3-32f303437286][meet]] and a [[id:0d2844c1-3cc9-4de8-ab4d-13fbe622963e][join]].

We say that a lattice is *bounded* if it has a minimum and maximum element.

* Extrema
** Maximum
A maximum element of a lattice \(L\) is an element \(1_{L}\in L\) such that for any \(x\in L\) we have \(x \le 1_{L}\).
** Minimum
A minimum element of a lattice \(L\) is an element \(0_{L}\) such that for any \(x \in L\) we have \(0_{L} \le x\).

* Example
Every [[id:fd07fdd8-c9af-49c8-81c1-614d4d0be12a][chain]] is a lattice.

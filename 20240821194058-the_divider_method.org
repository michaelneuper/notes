#+title: The Divider Method
#+filetags: combinatorics

* Definition
#+begin_quote
The number of ways of sorting \(n\) *indistinguishable* objects into \(r\) containers (\(r-1\) dividers) is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{(n+r-1)!}{n!(r-1)!} = {n+r-1 \choose r-1}
\end{equation*}
#+end_quote

* Example
Four cookies are distributed between Tom, Dick, and Harry in such a way that each gets at least one cookie.
The 4 cookies are traditionally represented as stars (****).
But here, they are shown as cookie-colored circles (●●●●).
The 3 gaps between the cookies are indicated by red carets (^ ^ ^).
[[file:images/cookies.svg]]
With three people, we need 2 bar symbols (| |) to occupy any two of the three gaps.
Hence the problem reduces to finding the binomial coefficient \({\displaystyle {\tbinom {3}{2}}}\).
Also shown are the three corresponding 3-compositions of 4.

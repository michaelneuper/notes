#+title: Graph

* Definition
A graph \(G = (V, E)\) is a finite nonempty [[id:56ae2cf4-a426-46fd-82eb-9acb3c8512ba][set]] of vertices/nodes \(V(G)\) connected with a possibly empty set of edges \(E(G)\).

* Terminology
** Graph order
\begin{equation*}
p(G) = \lvert V(G) \rvert
\end{equation*}
** Graph size
\begin{equation*}
q(G) = \lvert E(G) \rvert
\end{equation*}
** Graph density
\begin{equation*}
\frac{q(G)}{\binom{p(G)}{2}}
\end{equation*}
A graph is called dense if its density is close to 1 and sparse if it is close to 0.

* Neighbourhoods
** Open
All the vertices adjacent to a vertex excluding the vertex itself.
\begin{equation*}
N_{G}(v) = \{u \in V(G) : uv \in E(G)\}
\end{equation*}
** Closed
All the vertices adjacent to a vertex including the vertex itself.
\begin{equation*}
N_{G}[v] = N_{G}(v) \cup \{v\}
\end{equation*}

* Degree \(\deg_{G}(v)\)
+ Minimum degree: \(\delta(G) = \min_{1 \le i \le p} \{\deg_G(v_i)\}\)
+ Maximum degree: \(\Delta(G) = \max_{1 \le i \le p} \{\deg_G(v_i)\}\)

#+title: Areas Between Curves
#+filetags: calculus

* Definition
The area \(A\) of the region bounded by the curves \(y = f(x)\), \(y = g(x)\), and the lines \(x=a\), \(x=b\), where \(f\) and \(g\) are [[id:9f66f38c-1072-4146-9efe-5a90f984d480][continuous]] and \(f(x) \ge g(x)\), for all \(x \in [a,b]\), is the following [[id:7256d12e-eb3d-48d1-8f12-7168c6fe8522][integral]]

\begin{equation*}
A = \int_a^{b} \left[f(x) - g(x)\right] \, dx
\end{equation*}

* With Intersection
The area between the curves \(y=f(x)\) and \(y=g(x)\) between \(x=a\) and \(x=b\) is
\begin{equation*}
A = \int_{a}^{b} |f(x) - g(x)| \, dx
\end{equation*}

* Note
Sometimes it is easier to integrate w.r.t. \(y\), for example the line \(y = x - 1\) and \(y^2=2x + 6\).

* Area of a Parametric Curve
Given [[id:f3d337c4-5616-4dfa-91b2-58c7738b2473][parametric equations]] \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) where the curve is traced as \(t\) increases from \(\alpha\) to \(\beta\)
\begin{equation*}
A = \int_{a}^{b} y \, dx = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta}y \frac{dx}{dt} \, dt
\end{equation*}
where \(a = x(\alpha)\) and \(b = x(\beta)\).

* Area with [[id:e173dcae-762b-43a3-9ca4-599e2ba6c76a][Polar Coordinates]]
\begin{equation*}
A = \int_{a}^{b}\frac{1}{2}r^{2} \, d\theta
\end{equation*}
where \(r = f(\theta)\)

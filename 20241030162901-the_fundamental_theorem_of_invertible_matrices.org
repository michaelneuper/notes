#+title: The Fundamental Theorem of Invertible Matrices

* Version 1
#+begin_quote
Let \( A \) be an \( n \times n \) matrix. The following statements are equivalent:
- \( A \) is [[id:a6202f63-ca6f-4b31-ad25-4e57ec040e6e][invertible]].
- \( A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \) has a unique solution for every \( \mathbf{b} \) in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
- \( A \mathbf{x} = 0 \) has only the trivial solution.
- The reduced row echelon form of \( A \) is \( I_n \).
- \( A \) is a product of elementary matrices.

* Definition
Trials are repeated executions of the same experiment, such that:
- each execution has the same [[id:33838eb4-aa50-4794-baa1-637ddea744ad][sample space]] as all the others
- the outcome of each execution is [[id:cfdcb584-4895-41eb-9c8a-d9dc66e2bd2c][independent]] of the other executions

* Example
Flip a coin repeatedly.
Each trial has the sample space \(\{H, T\}\).

Let \(E_i\) be the event of getting \(H\) on trial \(i\).

Then events \(E_1, E_2, E_3,\cdots\) are all independent.

For example, \(P(E_1E_2E_3) = P(E_1)P(E_2)P(E_3)\)

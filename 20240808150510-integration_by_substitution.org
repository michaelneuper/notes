#+title: Integration by Substitution
#+filetags: calculus integration

* Definition
#+begin_quote
Integration by substitution, also known as u-substitution is a method for evaluating [[id:7256d12e-eb3d-48d1-8f12-7168c6fe8522][integrals]] and [[id:e606e6fc-c0e4-4d39-ad9f-704161129f5c][antiderivatives]].
It is the counterpart to the chain rule for [[id:a350707f-ba1b-4912-ad8d-60e80e1c5d47][differentiation]], and can loosely be thought of as using the chain rule "backwards."

* Example
Compute \(\int (2x^{3}+1)^{7}(x^{2})\,dx.\)

Let \(u=2x^{3}+1\).
This means that \(\frac {du}{dx}=6x^{2}\) or as differential form, \(du=6x^{2}\,dx\)

\begin{aligned}
\int (2x^{3}+1)^{7}(x^{2})\,dx&={\frac {1}{6}}\int \underbrace {(2x^{3}+1)^{7}} _{u^{7}}\underbrace {(6x^{2})\,dx} _{du}\\&={\frac {1}{6}}\int u^{7}\,du\\&={\frac {1}{6}}\left({\frac {1}{8}}u^{8}\right)+C\\&={\frac {1}{48}}(2x^{3}+1)^{8}+C
\end{aligned}

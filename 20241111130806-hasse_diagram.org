#+title: Hasse Diagram

Given a finite [[id:e64ef180-2fff-4790-bf03-1920ea80b239][poset]] \(P\), and element \(b\in P\) is said to *cover* an element \(a \in P\) if \(a \le_{P} b\) and \(a\ne b\) and there is no element in \(P\) which is strictly between \(a\) and \(b\).
That is, for any \(x\in P\), if we have \(a\le_{P} x\le_{P} b\) then \(x=a\) or \(x=b\).
We can give a bottom-to-top visual representation of \(P\) the following way:
- for each \(p \in P\) assign the element \(p\) a label
- for any element \(a,b\in P\) if \(b\) covers \(a\), then draw an arrow from the label of \(a\) to the label of \(b\)
- draw arrows in such a way that they are always pointing in an upward direction

* Example
The power set \(\mathcal{P}(\{x, y\}) = \{\emptyset, \{x\}, \{y\}, \{x, y\}\}\) forms a poset ordered by \(\subseteq\) with the following hasse diagram:

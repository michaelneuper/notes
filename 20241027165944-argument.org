#+title: Argument

* Definition
#+begin_quote
The argument \(\theta\) of a [[id:d59a3705-6045-4b74-8e99-a42b4cbacbbe][complex number]] \(z = a + bi\), denoted \(\arg(z)\), is the angle between the positive real axis and the line joining the origin and \(z\).
It can be computed using the following formula:
\begin{equation*}
\tan\theta = \frac{b}{a}
\end{equation*}
#+end_quote

* Note
The argument is not unique since any two arguments of \(z\) differ by an integer multiple of \(2\pi\).

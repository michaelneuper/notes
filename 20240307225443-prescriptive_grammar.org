#+title: Prescriptive Grammar

- Standards that specify the "correct" use of a given language
- Prescribes rules which speakers ought to use, rather than describing rules which speakers actually use
- Unscientific - based on naive ideas of what "pure" or "logical" is in a language
- Mainly influences written language

#+title: Features of Human Language
#+filetags: linguistics_foundations

* Use of Vocal-auditory Channel
- Communication possible while performing other actions
- Communication possible over long distances
- *NOT* a necessary feature
  - Sign language
  - Written language
  - Braille
- Not unique to humans

* Total Feedback
- Speakers hear their own speech and can monitor it
- Different from other communication systems
  - Traffic signs
- Not found in animal languages

* Arbitrariness
- Human language = symbolic system
  - Arbitrary relationship between form and meaning
- 'Animal languages' *usually* natural relationship between form and meaning

* Semanticity
- Specific language signals refer to specififc objects/actions/states/etc.
- Unclear whether animal sign refers to specific objects

* Duality of Patterning
- Seperate language units can be recombined in different orders
- Evidence from language erros such as spoonerisms

* Cultural transmission
- Humans born with the capacity to acquire any language
  - BUT must be exposed to (a) language to develop
- Absent from almost all animal languages

* Displacement
- Makes it possible to communicate about things (events, objects, experiences) that are removed in terms of time and space
  - past/present/future
  - physically distant things
  - imaginary things
- Animals can only communicate about /here/ and /now/

* Reflexivity
- We use language to communicate about human language
  - Metalinguistic [[id:e3f34a3e-5d74-4414-9ad7-93f381e576e3][function]]
- Not found in animal languages

* Creativity
- Ability to produce and understand a potentially infinite number of [[id:d974a4cd-8904-4d95-9ca7-e5b1cbba41e8][utterances]]
- Not dependent on / determined by external or internal stimuli
- Unique to humans

* Structure Dependency
- Words are combined according to specific patterns or structures, expressed by means of specific language rules
- Fluent speakers have subconscious knowledge of such structures and can manipulate specific units in a structure

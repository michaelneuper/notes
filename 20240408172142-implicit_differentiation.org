* Method of Implicit Differentiation
#+begin_quote
To find the [[id:a350707f-ba1b-4912-ad8d-60e80e1c5d47][derivative]] of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) when \(x\) and \(y\) are [[id:72a5316f-9b83-4c20-aa2e-42ffe2813cfb][related]] by an equation \(F(x,y) = G(x,y)\)

Differentiate both sides with respect to \(x\) and solve for \(\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}\)

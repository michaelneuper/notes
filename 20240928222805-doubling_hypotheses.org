#+title: Doubling Hypotheses
#+filetags: performance

* Definition
#+begin_quote
For a great many programs, we can quickly formulate a hypothesis for the following question: /What is the effect on the running time of
doubling the size of the input?/ For clarity, we refer to this hypothesis as a *doubling hypothesis*.
#+end_quote

* Example
** Hypothesis
The running time of my program is \(T_N \sim a N^b\).

** Consequence
As \(N\) increases, \(T_{2N}/T_N\) approaches \(2^{b}\).

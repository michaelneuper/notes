Suppose \(c\) is a [[id:f66472e4-0f97-494d-91e0-0e70cd6026ef][critical number]] of a [[id:9f66f38c-1072-4146-9efe-5a90f984d480][continuous]] function \(f\).

(a) If \(f'\) changes from positive to negative at \(c\), then \(f\) has a [[id:8e80da2f-092f-476a-b5f8-08749dc9dc1e][local maximum]] at \(c\).
(b) If \(f'\) changes from negative to positive at \(c\), then \(f\) has a [[id:8e80da2f-092f-476a-b5f8-08749dc9dc1e][local minimum]] at \(c\).
(c) If \(f'\) is positive to the left and right of \(c\), or if \(f'\) is negative to the left and right of \(c\), then \(f\) has no local maximum or minimum at \(c\).

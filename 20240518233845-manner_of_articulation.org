- (Oral) Stop → the airflow through the oral cavity (mouth) is blocked for a moment. (p, b, t,
g, k, d, ʔ)
- Nasal → the airflow through the mouth is blocked and the air is forced through the nose.
(m,n, ŋ)
- Fricative → the airflow is partially blocked, leading to friction btw. the air and your mouth.
(f, v, s, z, x, h, θ, ð, ʃ, ʒ )
- Affricate → the airflow is first blocked / stop and is then slowly released. [t ͜ ʃ], [d ͜ ʒ]
- Glide → sounds that are produced with only a little ebit of obstruction in the airflow. (w, j)
- Liquid → the airflow is a bit constructed, but not enough to cause friction btw. the air and
the mouth. [r], [ɹ], [R], [l]

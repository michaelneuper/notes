#+title: The Digraph of a Relation
#+filetags: relations_and_digraphs

* Definition
If \( A \) is a finite [[id:56ae2cf4-a426-46fd-82eb-9acb3c8512ba][set]] and \( R \) is a [[id:72a5316f-9b83-4c20-aa2e-42ffe2813cfb][relation]] on \( A \), we can also represent \( R \) pictorially as follows.
Draw a small circle for each element of \( A \) and label the circle with the corresponding element of \( A \).
These circles are called *vertices*.
Draw an arrow, called an *edge*, from vertex \( a_i \) to vertex \( a_j \) if and only if \( a_i \, R \, a_j \).
The resulting pictorial representation of \( R \) is called a *directed graph* or [[id:41b9dca8-794f-4c73-9062-8d4937f271bd][digraph]] of \( R \).

Thus, if \( R \) is a relation on \( A \), the edges in the digraph of \( R \) correspond exactly to the pairs in \( R \), and the vertices correspond exactly to the elements of the set \( A \).
Sometimes, when we want to emphasize the geometric nature of some property of \( R \), we may refer to the pairs of \( R \) themselves as edges and the elements of \( A \) as vertices.

* Notes
Given an element \(x\in X\)
- The *in-degree* of \(x\) (relative to \(R\)) is the number of elements \(y\) such that \(y \mathrel{R} x\).
  \begin{equation*}
  | \{y \in X \mid y \mathrel{R} x\} |
  \end{equation*}
- The *out-degree* of \(x\) (relative to \(R\)) is the number of elements \(y\) such that \(x \mathrel{R} y\).
  \begin{equation*}
  | \{y \in X \mid x \mathrel{R} y\} |
  \end{equation*}

* Example
Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \)
and
\(R = \{(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 1)\}.\)
Then the digraph of \( R \) is as shown in below.

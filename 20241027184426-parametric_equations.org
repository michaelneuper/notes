#+title: Parametric Equations

* Definition
#+begin_quote
Suppose \(x\) and \(y\) are both given as [[id:87d42439-b03b-48be-84ab-2215b4733dd7][functions]] of a third variable \(t\), called a *parameter* by the equations
\begin{equation*}
x = f(t) \qquad y = g(t)
\end{equation*}
which are called *parametric equations*.

Each value of \(t\) determines a point \((x,y)\) in a coordinate plane.
As \(t\) varies, the point \((x,y) = (f(t), g(t))\) varies and traces out a curve called a *parametric curve*.

* Tangents
Using the [[id:99f8249c-f8d2-4fb6-bcf4-381e24cd029a][Chain Rule]], we get the following formula
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt} \qquad \text{if}\qquad \frac{dx}{dt} \ne 0
\end{equation*}

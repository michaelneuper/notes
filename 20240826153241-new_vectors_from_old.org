If we want to follow one [[id:81c97780-c8a5-4652-a6eb-d33732c37f1e][vector]] with another and are interested in calculating the total displacement of the two vectors, then this leads to the notion of *vector addition*.

* The Head-to-tail Rule
Given vectors \(\vec{u}\) and \(\vec{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), translate \(\vec{v}\) so that its tail coincides with the head of \(\vec{u}\).
The sum \(\vec{u} + \vec{v}\) is the vector from the tail of \(\vec{u}\) to the head of \(\vec{v}\).

* The Parallelogram Rule
Given vectors \(\vec{u}\) and \(\vec{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) (in standard form), their sum \(\vec{u} + \vec{v}\) is the vector in standard position along the diagonal of the parallelogram determined by \(\vec{u}\) and \(\vec{v}\).

#+title: Maximum Flow Problem

* Problem
Find the maximum flow \(F\) we can get from the source node \(s\) to sink node \(t\) subject to the constraints:
+ the flow along an arc does not exceed its capacity
+ the flow into a vertex is equal to the flow out of a vertex (except for \(s\) and \(t\))

* Definitions
For each arc \(\overrightarrow{v_{i}v_{j}}\) we define
+ \(c_{ij}\): the capacity of arc \(\overrightarrow{v_{i}v_{j}}\)
+ \(f_{ij}\):  the flow through arc \(\overrightarrow{v_{i}v_{j}}\)
+ \(e_{ij}\): the excess capacity of arc \(\overrightarrow{v_{i}v_{j}}\)
  - = \(c_{ij} - f_{ij}\)

* Maximise \(F\)
subject to \(f_{ij} \le c_{ij}\) for all  \(\overrightarrow{v_{i}v_{j}} \in E(D)\)

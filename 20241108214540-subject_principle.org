#+title: Subject Principle

* Definition
Every complete sentence must have a subject.

/ *The dog* saw the squirrel./

* Note
In English, the subject must be pronounced. A subject that is pronounced is called a *perceptible/overt subject*.
In some other languages, the subject can be pronounced, but it is not necessary.
In the sentences where the subject is not pronounced, the subject is *imperceptible/covert*.

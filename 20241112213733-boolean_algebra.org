#+title: Boolean Algebra

* Definition
A *boolean algebra* is a bounded [[id:1e9d1801-01ef-4a38-be88-fde96d86907d][distributive lattice]] in which every element has a [[id:4d510a2a-b58f-4060-86d9-fcec807ec774][complement]].

* Notation
- We denote the top/max element of \(L\) by \(1\) and the bottom/min element of \(L\) by \(0\).
- We denote the complement of an element \(x\) by \(\neg x\).

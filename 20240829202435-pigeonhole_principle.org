#+title: Pigeonhole Principle
#+filetags: combinatorics theorem

* Definition
#+begin_quote
If \(n\) pigeons are assigned to \(m\) pigeonholes, and \(m<n\), then at least one pigeonhole contains two or more pigeons.
#+end_quote

* For Functions
#+begin_quote
For any [[id:87d42439-b03b-48be-84ab-2215b4733dd7][function]] \(f:X\to Y\), if \(|Y|<|X|\) then are two elements \(x_1,x_2\in X\) such that \(x_1=x_2\) and \(f(x_1)=f(x_2)\)
#+end_quote

* Example
Show that if any five numbers from 1 to 8 are chosen, then two of them will add to 9.

** Solution
Construct four different sets, each containing two numbers that add up to 9 as follows: \(A_1 = \{1,8\}, A_2 = \{2,7\}, A_3 = \{3,6\}, A_4 = \{4,5\}\).
Each of the five numbers chosen must belong to one of these sets.
Since there are only four sets, the pigeonhole principle tells us that two of the chosen numbers belong to the same set.
These numbers add up to 9.

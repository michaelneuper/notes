* Normal Form
The *normal form of the equation of a line \(\ell\)* in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p}) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{n}\cdot \mathbf{p}
\end{equation*}
where \(\mathbf{p}\) is a specific point on \(\ell\) and \(\mathbf{n} \ne \mathbf{0}\) is a normal [[id:81c97780-c8a5-4652-a6eb-d33732c37f1e][vector]] for \(\ell\).

* General Form
The *general form of the equation of a line \(\ell\)* in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is
\begin{equation*}
ax + by = c
\end{equation*}
where \(\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}\) is a normal vector for \(\ell\).

* Vector Form
The *vector form of the equation of a line \(\ell\)* in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{p} + t\mathbf{d}
\end{equation*}
where \(\mathbf{p}\) is a specific point on \(\ell\) and \(\mathbf{d} \ne \mathbf{0}\) is a direction vector of \(\ell\).
The equations corresponding to the components of the vector form of the equation are called [[id:f3d337c4-5616-4dfa-91b2-58c7738b2473][Parametric Equations]] of \(\ell\).

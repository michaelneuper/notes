#+title: Exponential Growth and Decay

* Definition
#+begin_quote
In general, if \(y(t)\) is the value of a quantity \(y\) at time \(t\) and if the rate of change of \(y\) with respect to \(t\) is proportional to its size \(y(t)\) at any time, then
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = ky
\end{equation*}
where \(k\) is a constant.

This is sometimes called the *law of natural growth* if \(k > 0\) or the *law of natural decay* if \(k<0\).

* Theorem
The only solutions of the [[id:7434ea42-2761-4665-979d-e8314e74fc3a][differential equation]] above are the [[id:62595d13-d132-4577-8f64-240eb88c750f][exponential functions]]
\begin{equation*}
y(t) = y(0) e^{kt}
\end{equation*}

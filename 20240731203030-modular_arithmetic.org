See [[id:c977d405-bd76-410c-bada-8cc025f39597][Division Theorem]].

The \(\mod n\) function: \(f_n(m) = r\)

Also denoted \(m\mod n\) or \(m\%n\)

* The Clock
A familiar use of modular arithmetic is in the 12-hour clock, in which the day is divided into two 12-hour periods.
If the time is 7:00 now, then 8 hours later it will be 3:00.
Simple addition would result in 7 + 8 = 15, but 15:00 reads as 3:00 on the clock face because clocks "wrap around" every 12 hours and the hour number starts over at zero when it reaches 12.

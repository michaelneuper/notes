* Reasons for Syntactic Knowledge
** Linguistic Creativity
- Creative aspect of a language
- Every fluent speaker has ability to produce and understand new phrases and sentences
- Cannot be stored in [[id:76abe154-3c50-40ed-896b-69bb6ccc7592][lexicon]] (by definition)
** Infiniteness of Language
- No (linguistic) constraint on *number of sentences* that can be formed
- No (linguistic) constraint on *length of sentences* that can be formed

* Syntactic Processes for Expanding Sentences
** Complementation
** Relativisation
** Co-ordination

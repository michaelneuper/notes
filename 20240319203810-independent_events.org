#+title: Independent Events
#+filetags: conditional_probability

* Definition
Events \(E\) and \(F\) are said to be independent if
\begin{equation*}
P(EF) = P(E)P(F)
\end{equation*}

Knowledge that one event occurred, does not influence the probability that the other event will occur.
So it follows that

\(P(E|F) = P(E)\) and \(P(F|E) = P(F)\)

* Proposition
If \(E\) and \(F\) are independent, then \(E\) and \(F^{c}\) are also independent.
** Proof
Suppose \(E\) and \(F\) are independent
\begin{align*}
P(E) &= P(EF) + P(EF^{c})
&= P(E)P(F) + P(EF^{c})
\end{align*}
since \(E=EF\cup EF^{c}\), with \(EF\) and \(EF^{c}\) [[id:b804e882-b52f-49fd-a577-bcae712bbb75][mutually exclusive]]
\begin{align*}
\therefore P(EF^{c}) &= P(E)(1-P(F))
&= P(E)P(F^{c})
\end{align*}
Therefore \(E\) and \(F^{c}\) are independent.

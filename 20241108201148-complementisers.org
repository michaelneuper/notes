#+title: Complementisers

* Definition
Words that are used to introduce [[id:1a3a4f9c-8567-40c1-9da9-1540139d5899][sentences]] / [[id:6855ed0e-8cd9-4f5e-ad8f-0b8dd3ec81e5][clauses]].

In other languags overt complementisers are also used to introduce main clauses.

* Examples
- She said [ *that* they are going overseas ]
- I doubt [ *if/whether* they will come ]
- I prefer [ *for* him to do the work ]

   |--------------+----------------------------|
   | finite       | infinite                   |

* Definition
#+begin_quote
- Mathematical statements are claims about mathematical objects which are either true or false.

- These can be written using mathematical symbols, but must be able to be rewritten in English as full sentences, including a *verb* and ending with a full stop.

- Statements that contain variables are called [[id:ac356044-060c-4b67-84f2-6361c9c574bb][predicates]].

- Statements can be [[id:c320994c-b8c2-4d38-8954-d75f1c8aa022][combined]] to form new statements.

#+title: Linear Technical Model of Communication

* Definition
Communication is viewed as a linear process which involves sending and receiving messages between a sender and a receiver.

*Sender*: The person who formulates, encodes and send the message

*Receiver*: The person who receives and decodes the message

* Assumptions
- The sender is the active participant while the receiver plays a passive role only
- The process of encoding and decoding happens unproblematically
- Not concerned with the complex ways in which people make meaning from word

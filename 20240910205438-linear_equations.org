* Definition
A *linear equation* is an equation in the \(n\) variables \(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\) is an equation that can be written in the form
\begin{equation*}
a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n=b
\end{equation*}
where \(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\) and \(b\) are constants.

* Notes
- A system of linear equations with real coefficients has either
  - a unique solution (a consistent system) or
  - infinitely many solutions (a consistent system) or
  - no solutions (an inconsistent system)

- Two linear systems are called equivalent if they have the same solution sets

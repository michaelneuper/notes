#+title: Coordination Test

* Definition
Used to determine whether two constituents belong to the same category.

[[id:ecfd3087-af93-4584-8524-3723b4796ccd][Conjunctions]] can co-ordinate/conjoin

A co-ordinate construction can contain two or more conjunctts but the conjuncts *must belong to the same [[id:18a6c1d4-46af-4fa4-9f17-3703208f5015][Word Class]]*.

* Test
Constituents that do not belog to the same category cannot be coordinated:
- *I saw a bird (VP) or under the table (PP)

* Note
Two elements cannot be coordinated if they do not have the same function, even though they may be constituents of the same category.
For example, if we tried to coordinate a PP that describes an NP with a PP that forms part of a VP, the result would be ungrammatical:
- *the bishop shot the bank manager _with a moustache_ and _with a gun_.
The PP “with a moustache” forms part of the NP “the bank manager with a moustache” and therefore cannot be coordinated with the PP “with a gun”.

#+title: Elementry Row Operations
#+filetags: linear_algebra linear_equations

* Definition
#+begin_quote
The following elementary row operations can be performed on a matrix:
- Interchange two rows.
- Multiply a row by a nonzero constant.
- Add a multiple of a row to another row.
#+end_quote

* Notation
- \(R_i\leftrightarrow R_j\) means interchange rows \(i\) and \(j\)
- \(kR_i\) means multiply row \(i\) by \(k\)
- \(R_i + kR_j\) means add \(k\) times row \(j\) to row \(i\) (and replace row \(i\) with the result).

The process of applying elementary row operations to bring a matrix into row echelon form, called *row reduction*, is used to reduce a matrix to echelon form.

#+title: Clauses

* Definition
A clause is a meaningful unit of language.
Can be a [[id:1a3a4f9c-8567-40c1-9da9-1540139d5899][sentence]] ("I see the dog"), but sometimes two or more clauses need to combine to form a sentence ("I know" + "that you are here").

The main element of a clause is the [[id:22dabe8b-5aec-443f-88eb-c23a4e8c728c][verb phrase]]: each clause must contain a VP.
The VP is usually accompanied by a subject [[id:8f34fe1c-acd6-4e4f-b609-7b73efea7336][noun phrase]].

You can determine the number of clauses in a sentence by counting the number of verb phrases.

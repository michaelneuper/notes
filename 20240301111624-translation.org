#+title: Translations

Let \(c\in\mathbb{R}\) with \(c>0\) and let \(f\) be any function. Then the graph of:
- \(y=f(x) + c\) is given by translating the graph of \(y=f(x)\) \(c\) units *upward*
- \(y=f(x) - c\) is given by translating the graph of \(y=f(x)\) \(c\) units *downward*
- \(y=f(x + c)\) is given by translating the graph of \(y=f(x)\) \(c\) units to the *right*
- \(y=f(x - c)\) is given by translating the graph of \(y=f(x)\) \(c\) units to the *left*

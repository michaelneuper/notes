#+title: Linear Independence

* Definition
A list of [[id:81c97780-c8a5-4652-a6eb-d33732c37f1e][vectors]] \(\mathcal{B} = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n\}\) in a vector space \(V\) is called *linearly independent* if the equation
\begin{equation*}
    k_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + k_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + k_n \mathbf{v}_n = 0
\end{equation*}
has only the trivial solution \( k_1 = k_2 = \dots = k_n = 0 \). Otherwise if it has a solution with at least one scalar \( k_i \neq 0 \)) the list \(\mathcal{B}\) is called *linearly dependent*.

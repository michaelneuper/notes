#+title: Composite Functions

* Definition
Given two [[id:87d42439-b03b-48be-84ab-2215b4733dd7][functions]] \(f : X \to Y\) and \(g : Y \to Z\) we define their composite, as \(g\circ f: X \to Y\) as the function where \((g\circ f)(x) = g(f(x))\).

* Notes
- \(f\circ g\) is read as
  - "\(f\) composed with \(g\)"
  - "the composite/composition of \(f\) and \(g\)"
  - "\(g\) then \(f\)"

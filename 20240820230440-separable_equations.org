* Definition
#+begin_quote
A separable equation is a first-order [[id:7434ea42-2761-4665-979d-e8314e74fc3a][General Differential Equation]] in which the expression for \(dy/dx\) can be factored as a function of \(x\) times a function of \(y\).
i.e. it can be written in the form

\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y) \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{g(x)}{h(y)}
\end{equation*}

* Method for Solving
- Seperate the variables so that all \(y\)'s are on one side and all \(x\)'s are on the other side.
- Integrate both sides.

* Intuitive Definition
#+begin_quote
Let \(f\) be a [[id:87d42439-b03b-48be-84ab-2215b4733dd7][function]] defined near \(a\), except possibly at \(a\).
Then
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = \infty
\end{equation*}
means that the values of \(f(x)\) can be made arbitrarily large by taking \(x\) sufficiently close to \(a\), but not equal to \(a\).

\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = -\infty
\end{equation*}
means that the values of \(f(x)\) can be made negative with arbitrarily large magnitude by taking \(x\) sufficiently close to \(a\), but not equal to \(a\).

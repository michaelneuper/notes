#+title: Reflexive Relations

* Definition
A [[id:72a5316f-9b83-4c20-aa2e-42ffe2813cfb][relation]] \(R\subseteq X^2\) is called *reflexive* if for all \(x\in X\) we have that \(x \mathrel{R} x\).

That is, each element must be related to itself.

* Theorem
A relation \(R\subseteq X^2\) is reflexive iff the [[id:313eb7b7-226a-4df4-8872-0c06f5104cec][diagonal]] of \(X\), denoted \(\Delta_X\subseteq R\).

* Example
Let \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \). A relation \( R \) on \( A \) is defined as follows:

\(R = \{ (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3) \}\)

This relation \( R \) is reflexive because for every element \( a \in A \), the pair \( (a, a) \) is in \( R \). Specifically:
- \((1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) \in R\)

Thus, \( R \) satisfies the reflexive property.
